# Extension Icons

Place your extension icons in this folder with the following sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create icons using:
- Figma, Sketch, or Adobe Illustrator
- Online tools like Canva or Photopea
- Icon generators

## Design Guidelines

- Use the ContentGenie brand colors (purple/blue gradient)
- Include a link/chain symbol to represent "LinkoGenei"
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Use transparent background (PNG format)

## Temporary Solution

Until you create custom icons, you can:
1. Use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG images
2. Rename them to icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png
3. Place them in this folder

The extension will work without icons, but Chrome will show a default placeholder.
